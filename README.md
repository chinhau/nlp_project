# NLP Project

This project uses the IMDB movies review dataset to explore and compare the performance of different NLP techniques and algorithms.

This project can be divided into 2 parts: 

1. Focus SOLELY on Monogram by exploring a couple of different techniques: 
   - Occurrence of Words, Word Count, Term Frequency, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
   - Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, XG Boost
   
2. Explore Feature Hashing (Fine-Tuning across different number of features) 
   Apply n = 25,000 : Monogram, Bigram, Trigram

The project can be divided into 2 parts: 

1. Focus SOLELY on Monogram by using a couple of different techniques ranging from occurrence of words, word count, term frequency, TF-IDF in order to compare the accuracy across different classifiers.
